Dear Abhay,<br><br>
This year felt magical because of you.  
Every smile, every late-night call, every small moment — I treasure them all.  
Thank you for being my constant, my comfort, my happiness.  
I’m so excited to create more memories with you in this new year.  
Happy New Year, my love ❤️
